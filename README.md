This program should read a list of items from an input and keep count of any repeated items. I think that I organized the code well into different functions.
One improvement that could potentially be made is to add code to read the list from a database.
A challenging part of creating this program might be saving a list internally and creating the histogram.
I think that most of the skills that I might have learned and or sharpened are very transferable to other programs.
For example, utilizing two different programming languages, C++, and Python, in one program and learning more about implementing Object Oriented Programming I think can be used for other projects as well.
I tried to name variables so that they are easily identified and comments to help my program be more maintainable, readable, and adaptable.
